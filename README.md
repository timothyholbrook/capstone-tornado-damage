Tornado damage since 1950 has been significant, with numerous destructive tornadoes causing 
extensive damage to crops and infrastructure as well as resulting in many casualties and injuries.

## Objective

The objective of this project is to analyze and present data on tornado occurrences in the United
States since 1950, showing the extent of damage inflicted on both crops and infrastructure.
Additionally, the project aims to present the number of injuries and fatalities resulting from
these disasters.

Questions:

-How many casualties and injuries do tornadoes typically inflict upon the United States annually?
-What is the impact on crop damage compared to property damage caused by tornadoes in the United 
  States? 

## Project Requirements
  
   1. Read TWO data files (JSON, CSV, Excel, etc.).
     - 1950-23 damage_fatal_injury.csv
     - 1950-2023_tor_fatalities.csv

  2. Clean your data and perform a pandas merge with your two data sets, then calculate some new
     values based on the new data set.
